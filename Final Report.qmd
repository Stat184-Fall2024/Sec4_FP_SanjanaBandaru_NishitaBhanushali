# IMDB Movies Data Analysis

## Introduction

```         
  - State your research questions and explain them. (What is our goal/purpose in this project? Why did we choose these questions? What does some of the jargon mean?)
  - Describe the provenance of your data. That is, where did you get the data, who collected the data, for what purpose, who/what make up the cases.
  - Explain how your data meet the FAIR and/or CARE Principles.
```

## Methodology

```         
  - Describe what attributes you'll focus your analysis on (mention if they are part of your data sets or if you created them out of your data sets).
  - How will the analysis be conducted and displayed?
  - What did we do to assess our data, pare down the variables, compare them, etc?
    - Talk about old vs new data sets
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Quantitative

```         
  - Create multiple data visualizations (tables and figures) that assist both the team and readers in understanding the data.
  - Narrative text explaining the context of the project to help the reader make sense of what is going on.
  - What are we seeing from the graphs? What’s important? What’s significant? What does what’s being displayed mean on both specific and wide levels?   
    - e.g. specific = definition, wide = relevance in project
  - Explain what the clumps, trends, shapes, etc. mean
  - Why did we use the visualizations we did?
